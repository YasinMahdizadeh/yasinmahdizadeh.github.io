 I also love both art and mathematics. I studied Mathematics and Physics in one of the best high schools in Iran. There, I spent my time programming and studying computer-related subjects. Afterwards, I began studying architecture as my bachelor's, in order to inform myself more about art. My studying has never been limited to the classroom, and I self-studied my favorite subjects wherever needed.
